Hello,

Please check some of my past projects:

I am a full-stack developer with expertise in Node.js, JavaScript, and AngularJS, specializing in custom-built E-commerce solutions. I have previously worked on scalable product catalogs, implemented efficient search algorithms, and designed secure shopping cart and checkout systems to enhance user experience. Additionally, I focus on user-friendly UI/UX, ensuring smooth navigation and optimal performance for E-commerce platforms. 

For your project, I would optimize the product catalog structure with indexed database queries for faster search results, implement secure authentication for user profiles, and create a seamless checkout process using session management and payment gateway integrations. By leveraging Node.js with efficient API design, I can ensure high performance and scalability for handling increasing traffic and transactions.

I have some technical questions:

Do you have any preferred payment gateways that need integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)?
How do you plan to handle product filtering and search optimization for better user experience?
Would you like real-time cart updates using WebSockets or a polling mechanism?
I'm able to provide unlimited revisions until you are satisfied with achieving the desired result.

Best Regards,
Bohdan
