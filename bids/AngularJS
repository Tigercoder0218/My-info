Hello,

First of all, please check some of my past projects.

As a Senior Angular Developer with 5+ years of experience, I have extensive expertise in UI development, State Management, and performance optimization. I have worked on complex Forms, Tables, and Modals, ensuring responsive and highly efficient UI components. I am confident in making the necessary enhancements and state adjustments within your tight 3-day deadline while maintaining high code quality.

For optimal performance, I will use RxJS for efficient state management, lazy loading for improved speed, and modular SCSS/CSS to refine UI consistency. Additionally, I will ensure all UI changes are fully tested for cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness.

I have some technical questions:

Should the state management adjustments be handled via NgRx, BehaviorSubjects, or another approach?
Do you have a specific performance benchmark that needs to be met for UI responsiveness?
Would you like unit tests and end-to-end testing to be included in the changes?

I'm able to provide unlimited revisions until you are satisfied with achieving the desired result.

Best Regards,
Yurii
