Hello,

First of all, please check my past projects:
https://meetingflow.com/(AI)
https://developers.moralis.com/(Blockchain)

II am an experienced full-stack developer with a strong background in Node.js, Python, React, and Solana blockchain development. I have successfully worked on various smart contract deployments, built blockchain solutions using Rust, and integrated AI-powered features like chatbots and analytics dashboards into web and mobile applications. Additionally, I have extensive experience in creating responsive mobile apps and ensuring seamless back-end integration.

To address your needs, I would use modern frameworks like React, Node.js, and Rust to build scalable solutions that integrate seamlessly across your platform. I would also leverage machine learning tools such as TensorFlow or scikit-learn for AI features and ensure the security of smart contracts with proper audits and code reviews.

I have some technical questions:

What specific blockchain standards or token systems are you using on Solana?
Can you describe the types of AI functionalities (e.g., NLP models, recommendation engines) you want integrated into your platform?
What are the primary security measures you require for smart contracts and blockchain solutions?

I'm able to provide unlimited revisions until you are satisfied with achieving the desired result.
Best regards,
Yurii
