Hello,

Please check some of my past projects.

As a Full Stack Developer specializing in WordPress, PHP, and modern UI/UX design, I can build your 6-7 page website with a sleek and responsive layout. I would integrate secure payment gateways, including Credit/Debit Cards, Stripe, and crypto, using WooCommerce and compatible plugins while ensuring smooth transactions. Additionally, Iâ€™d develop a login system for users to track their order history, optimize performance with caching and lazy loading, and ensure a fast, visually appealing experience across all devices.

I have some technical questions:

Do you have a preferred WordPress theme, or would you like a custom-built one?
Which cryptocurrency payment provider should be integrated, and are there specific compliance requirements?
Should the login system be custom-built or utilize existing WordPress user management features?
I'm able to provide unlimited revisions until you are satisfied with achieving the desired result.

Best Regards,
Bohdan
