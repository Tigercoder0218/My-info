///Python, OpenCV
Hello,

As a seasoned Python developer specializing in AI and Computer Vision, with extensive experience working with OpenCV, I am confident that my skills align perfectly with your project needs. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality image processing and stitching solutions incorporating automatic alignment and rotations, which would be crucial for creating panoramic images from your board camera captures.

Additionally, the fact that I have successfully developed real-time processing algorithms in the past gives me great confidence in my ability to meet your demand for quick stitching - 200 milliseconds per four images sounds challenging but not impossible! My proficiency extends beyond Python and OpenCV to include data-driven backend development. This means you can count on me to create efficient, optimized code that meets speed benchmarks without compromising on quality.

Furthermore, to better address specific nuances in your setup like slight rotations due to camera misalignments, I'll perform thorough testing and adjustment using additional images you provide. In essence, hiring me allows you to tap into a rich skillset which targets your specific needs and guarantees optimal delivery. I'm ready to start when you are!

Thanks!
