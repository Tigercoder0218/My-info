I am a software engineer. We develop web and mobile applications for individual clients, startups, or enterprise companies in the U.S and Canada. I'm most experienced in the IT industry. In my past experience, hiring managers liked my skills and experience but they were not moving forward with me because of my lack of English level. We are looking for a native English speaker/software developer to collaborate closely with me.

Your Role:
You will be joining all meetings (Google or Zoom) with the given profile name to do interviews with clients and pretend to be someone else during interviews. I book 3 - 5 interviews a day, which generally take 30 - 60 minutes. All profile info will be provided by us 1 - 2 hours before the meeting. You will be paid on a daily or weekly basis with agreed hourly rate.

Nice to have:
JavaScript, Typescript, React, React Native, Node.js, Python, Django, HTML, CSS, AWS, Blockchain, Solidity, Smart Contract

If you think this role would be a good fit for you, I'd be excited to continue our conversation.
Please feel free to drop me a line if you are interested.
