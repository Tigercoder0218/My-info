As a Full Stack Developer with expertise in Shopify optimization, UX/UI design, and conversion rate optimization, I have helped multiple stores improve their sales performance. To address your store's conversion issues, I would conduct an in-depth UX/UI audit, implement A/B testing on product pages, streamline the checkout flow, and integrate trust-building elements like social proof and security badges. Additionally, I would optimize site speed using lazy loading, asset compression, and Shopifyâ€™s native performance tools to enhance user experience.

Best Regards,
Oleksandr
