Hello,

First of all, please check some of my past projects:
https://n4lhealth.com/

I am a senior full-stack developer with extensive experience in Laravel, MySQL, and frontend technologies. I have successfully developed and deployed several web applications, including healthcare platforms. I specialize in integrating secure patient records management systems while ensuring scalability and compliance with industry standards. Given your ready HTML and CSS files, I can seamlessly integrate them into Laravelâ€™s Blade templating system and optimize the backend for performance and security.

I have some technical questions:

Will the patient records management system require HIPAA or GDPR compliance?
Do you have a preference for Eloquent ORM or raw SQL for data handling?
Should the backend include API endpoints for future mobile app integration?
I am ready to start working on your project right now.
Looking forward to collaborating.

Best Regards,
Oleksandr
