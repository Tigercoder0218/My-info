Hello,

First of all, please check some of my past projects.

With extensive experience in WordPress development and eCommerce solutions, I specialize in managing multiple websites, ensuring they are well-maintained, optimized for SEO, and continuously updated with engaging content. I can implement automated content updates, optimize product listings for search engines, and apply performance-enhancing techniques to improve loading speed and user experience. My approach includes data-driven marketing strategies to boost visibility and increase conversion rates.

I have some technical questions:

Do you have a preferred SEO strategy, or should I conduct an audit to suggest improvements?
Would you like a custom maintenance dashboard to streamline content updates?
Are there any specific marketing tools or plugins you prefer for sales optimization?
I'm able to provide unlimited revisions until you are satisfied with achieving the desired result.

Best Regards,
Oleksandr
