Hello,

üåüFirst of all, please check some of my past projects.üåü

As a full-stack developer with over four years of experience in React, Next.js, and Node.js, I have built and optimized scalable applications that are SEO-friendly, mobile-responsive, and high-performing. My expertise includes managing application state using Redux, working with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Firebase Firestore, and integrating GraphQL and REST APIs for efficient data handling. I have also leveraged Webflow, Figma, and Tailwind CSS to translate UI/UX designs into functional applications while ensuring clean and maintainable code.

To optimize front-end performance and ensure scalability, I implement server-side rendering (SSR), static generation (SSG), and lazy loading techniques. For authentication and security, I utilize Firebase Authentication, JWT, and OAuth-based solutions to provide seamless and secure user experiences. Additionally, I ensure smooth deployment through CI/CD pipelines and best DevOps practices.

I have some technical questions:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Do you prefer Redux Toolkit or Zustand for state management, considering the project complexity?
2Ô∏è‚É£ Will the project require real-time database updates, and if so, should we implement Firebase Firestore listeners or WebSockets?
3Ô∏è‚É£ Are there specific SEO requirements, such as dynamic meta tag handling in Next.js?

I'm able to provide unlimited revisions until you are satisfied with achieving the desired result.

Best Regards,
Bohdan
