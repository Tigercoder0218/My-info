Hello,
Please check some of my past projects.

I’m a Front-End Developer with extensive experience in front-end development using React, TypeScript, and CSS, specializing in converting Figma designs into highly functional, pixel-perfect UIs. 
I have solid experience implementing reusable components, maintaining structured project patterns, and using mock APIs to make the UI interactive before backend development is completed.

For this project, I would ensure code consistency by following best practices in naming conventions and folder structures while optimizing performance with efficient state management. 
Using TypeScript’s strong typing, I can improve maintainability and scalability while ensuring seamless Git workflows for collaboration.
Regards,
Pavlo
