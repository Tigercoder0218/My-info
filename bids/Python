As a full-stack developer with expertise in Python, and several data analytics, I have worked extensively on optimizing data-driven scripts and automating financial workflows. I can debug and enhance your Python script by improving API integration, refining OCR processing for PDF data extraction, and implementing performance optimizations to ensure seamless interaction with Bloomberg's financial data services. Utilizing advanced error handling, parallel processing, and data validation techniques, I will enhance the scriptâ€™s reliability and speed.

I'm able to provide unlimited revisions until you are satisfied with achieving the desired result.

Best Regards,
Bohdan.
