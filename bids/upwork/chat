Hi there, thank for applying for this project. Do you have other projects you are currently working on at the moment? How many hours a week can you dedicate to this project?
Do you have an example of a recent React JS application you have worked on and deployed to production?

Pavlo Honcharuk 4:58 AM
Hi Akinyemi, thanks for your reply.
I don't have any ongoing project at the moment. I'm available to work at least 40 hours per a week for the next 6 months.

Do you have any question for me on the project?
Pavlo Honcharuk 6:14 AM
Should the mock APIs follow a specific structure or standard (e.g., JSON:API, GraphQL, or RESTful)?
I would like to follow RESTful principles for simplicity and wide compatibility unless GraphQL is preferred for more flexible data fetching. I have the ability to structure the mock API using tools like JSON Server or MirageJS, ensuring a well-organized, scalable approach.
What state management approach is preferred—React Context, Redux, Zustand, or another solution? Is this particular project small or medium-sized one?
If so, I would like to use React Context with useReducer. If large application, I would like to recommend Redux Toolkit.
I'll ask more questions after I learn more about your project.

The web application uses WebAPI with JSON payload - it will be important to mimic that for mocking
The API is RESTful - so well aligned
Once we start and you review the existing project, you can decide on the best approach - This is going to be a very large platform

Pavlo Honcharuk 7:08 AM
Thank you for the clarification. If the project uses a RESTful API with JSON payload, I can mimicke the API structure using mock data tools like JSON Server or other.
I'm ready to start right away and I'm available to work 40 hours a week for the next 6-12 months.

I see this project in phases, the current phase we are in will run for a few weeks, to get the Figma files into functioning React JS. Once we are done with phases, there is likely going to be new Figma files for some new advance concepts, then we will proceed with that. We have a roadmap that is very long but first we need to deliver on Min Viable Product

Pavlo Honcharuk 11:18 AM
That makes sense.
Exciting! When would you like me to start working on the implementation?

Pavlo Honcharuk 5:40 PM
Good morning!

Akinyemi Koyi 6:03 PM
Good morning Pavlo
Pavlo Honcharuk 6:04 PM
How are you doing?
AK

Akinyemi Koyi 6:13 PM
I see your proposal is at $30/hr, it that your best rate? I would like to work with you long term but need to get the rates right

Pavlo Honcharuk 6:23 PM
yeah, my proposal is $30/hr. I'm open to discussing a long-term contract. What kind of budget are you considering?
AK

Akinyemi Koyi 6:29 PM
My preference is $20/hr if hourly (this is going to be a long term engagement if all works out - which I think it will) and I am also opened to doing a fixed term based - with payments on milestones.

Pavlo Honcharuk 6:32 PM
I appreciate your offer and your interest in a long-term contract. My standard rate is $30/hr, but for a long-term contract, I can offer $25/hr. This ensures I can dedicate my time and expertise to delivering high-quality work consistently. Let me know if that works for you!

Pavlo Honcharuk 8:13 PM
What do you think?
I'm excited to join your team and collaborate with you.
AK

Akinyemi Koyi 8:34 PM
Same, I am very excited to getting this going soon. The previous development team was from Ukraine too.
Pavlo Honcharuk 8:51 PM
Ok, sounds good.

Thank you for your chance.
I reviewed the project requirement document, and it looks excellent.
It’s clean, modern, and highly user-friendly, particularly for business professionals.
The structure is well-organized, and the list display section stands out as intuitive and easy to navigate.
For page 179, I recommend refining the advanced section’s UI/UX to enhance usability.
Implementing Tailwind CSS would be a great choice for this project, as it provides better design flexibility, improved maintainability, and optimized performance compared to Bootstrap.
Of course, if you prefer to keep the original design, I’ll implement it accordingly.
There shouldn’t be any major challenges in converting this to React, but to ensure a well-structured and high-quality implementation, I’d appreciate access to it if you have the backend API documentation.
This will help me align the UI efficiently with the data structure and business logic.
What about your opinion?
