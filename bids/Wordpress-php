Hello,

First of all, please check some of my past projects.

As a full-stack developer with extensive experience in website migrations, I have successfully transferred numerous WordPress and custom PHP sites while preserving content, design, and functionality. I will ensure a smooth migration from GoDaddy to IONOS by securely transferring databases, files, and DNS settings, minimizing downtime. Additionally, I will test the site post-migration to guarantee everything remains intact and fully functional.

I have some technical questions:

Will the current hosting environment on GoDaddy be accessible throughout the migration process?
Do you have email accounts linked to the domain that also need to be migrated?
Are there any specific database or CMS configurations that require special attention?
I'm able to provide unlimited revisions until you are satisfied with achieving the desired result.

Best Regards,
Oleksandr
