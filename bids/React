Hello,

Please check some of my past projects:

As a full-stack developer with expertise in React.js, React Hooks, and Redux, I have extensive experience building and maintaining dynamic, responsive web applications. I will develop an optimized front-end architecture, ensuring seamless API integration and efficient state management using Redux and Context API for scalability. By leveraging React Hooks, I can enhance component reusability and performance while implementing best practices such as lazy loading, memoization, and server-side rendering for a smooth user experience.

I have some technical questions:
Do you have a preferred state management approach, or should Redux be used exclusively?
Will API integration involve RESTful services, GraphQL, or WebSockets for real-time updates?
Are there specific performance benchmarks or accessibility requirements for the application?

I'm able to provide unlimited revisions until you are satisfied with achieving the desired result.

Best Regards,
Bohdan
